### The ***flags*** parameter in the open system call:

| Symbolic Constant  | Description  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| O_RDONLY  | Read Only  |
| O_WRONLY  | Write Only  |
| O_RDWR  | Read and Write  |
| O_TRUNC  |  Truncated mode. If the file exists and the access mode allows writing to it (`O_WRONLY` ou `O_RDWR`), truncates its contents to 0 size when it is opened, with the effect of overwriting the file.|
| O_APPEND  | Append mode. The file offset is set to the end of the file at each write, with the effect of adding text to the end of the file instead of overwriting it. |
| O_CREAT  | Creates the file if it does not already exist. Its permissions must then be specified in `open`‘s _mode_ parameter.|
