A File Descriptor or `fd` is a small positive integer used as a reference to an open file in process.

However, from the operating system’s point of view, a file is not only a text file as we might think of it as a user. A file can also be a directory or even another type of input/output resource such as a keyboard, a screen, [a pipe](https://www.codequoi.com/en/pipe-an-inter-process-communication-method/) or a network socket.

By default, each process systematically inherits three open file descriptors :

| File Descriptor | Name | <unistd.h> | <stdio.h> |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0 | Standard Input | STDIN_FILENO | stdin |  
| 1 | Standard Output | STDOUT_FILENO | stdout |  
| 2 | Standard Error | STDERR_FILENO | stderr |  

**But why use file descriptors as identifiers?**
An integer is much simpler to process for a computer than a long path string to a file.
What’s more, the reference to a file must contain much more than its location:
it must also include its permissions, access mode, size, etc…
