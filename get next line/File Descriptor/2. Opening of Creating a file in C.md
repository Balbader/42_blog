```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
```

	. pathname: the path towards the file in the form of a string of characters.
	. flags: an integer reresenting the flags indicating the access mode, which we will take a closer look at below
	. mode: an integer reresenting the permissions to give to the file upon creation. This is an "optional" parameter that will be ignored if we don't ask to create the file if it doesn't already exist.

> !!! NOTE: If there is an issue, `open` will return -1.
