```c
#include <unistd.h>

pid_t fork(void);
```

As the ***child*** process is and exact clone of ***parent***, they both will have the exact same code.
The return value of the `fork` function, which is of an integer type `pid_t` will allow us to distinguish the parent from the child as each will have a unique ***PID***.

There are 3 possible return values with the `fork` function:
1. The parent receives the child's PID
2. The child receives 0
3. In case of an `Error`, the return value is `-1`

> !!! NOTE: If the return value is 0, then we are in the child process, else if the return value is greater than 0, then we are in the parent process.

> !!!NOTE: It is important to note that the child parent receives the parent `program counter` or `instruction pointer` which contains the address in memory of the instruction being currently executed.

Code to create a child process:
```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int	main(void)
{
	pid_t	pid;

	printf("Fork initiated!\n");
	pid = fork();
	if (pid == -1)
		return (1);
	printf("fork Success:\n");
	if (pid == 0)
		printf("Child process: PID is %d\n", pid);
	else if (pid > 0)
		printf("Parent process: PID is %d\n", pid);
	return (0);
}
```

> !!! NOTE : The parent and the child being identical, same code, same open fd, same data stored in memory, etc... The memory is identical but it is not shared between the two processes.
> In other words, if the parent changed the value of one of its variables after creating the child, the child will not see any changes when it reads the same variable.
